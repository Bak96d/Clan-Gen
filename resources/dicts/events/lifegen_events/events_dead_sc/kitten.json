        "You run around StarClan territory with r_c_sc, yelling, laughing, and never getting tired.",
        "You wander a bit too close to the Dark Forest border. Before you can say hello to the glowing pair of eyes you spy through the brambles, r_c_sc grabs you and quickly rushes you back to familiar territory.",
        "As you playfully chase a feather, it gets stuck under your claw and vanishes into the starry night.",

        "You feel a pang of guilt as you watch your littermates grow up without you and wish you could switch places with them.",
