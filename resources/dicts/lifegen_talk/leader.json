            "Ah, there you are, little one. I've been watching you play, pretending to be a warrior. You certainly have the spirit. I remember when I was a kit, dreaming of the day when I would earn my warrior name.",
            "One day, you'll be out there, hunting, patrolling, defending our Clan just like the warriors you admire so much. But for now, your job is to learn and to play. It's through play that kits learn the most valuable skills.",
            "You know, each and every warrior in our Clan started just where you are. We all had dreams, made mistakes, faced challenges. But the most important thing is that we never gave up. And I see that same determination in you.",
            "But being a warrior is not just about strength or speed. It's about loyalty, respect, and... you're not listening anymore are you?",
            "Ah young one. I may have gotten carried away. Go on, go play. May StarClan guide your steps."
