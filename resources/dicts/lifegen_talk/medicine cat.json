            "But remember, young one, this den isn't just for fun. It's a place of healing and rest. The herbs here, they aren't just leaves and flowers. Each has a purpose, a role to play in keeping our Clan healthy and strong.",
            "See this leaf? It's called yarrow. It can help a cat vomit if they've eaten something poisonous. And this one, the bright yellow flower? That's marigold, good for preventing infection in wounds.",
            "A medicine cat's duty is not just to heal, but also to listen to StarClan. They guide us, give us omens and signs. It's a big responsibility, but it's also an honor. We are the bridge between our Clan and our ancestors.",
            "But don't worry, being a kit is the perfect time to learn. Curiosity is a gift, one that you should nurture. Just remember to respect the den and what it represents.",
            "And who knows? Maybe one day you'll be the one teaching a curious kit about the ways of a medicine cat."

            "Being a warrior isn't just about strength and bravery. It's also about knowing when to seek help. Your body speaks its own language, and you must listen to it. A hurt ignored can turn into a wound that won't heal.",

            "There is no shame in seeking help, and there's no strength in suffering in silence. You are a brave and respected warrior, and your Clanmates look up to you. But even the bravest warriors need help sometimes."
