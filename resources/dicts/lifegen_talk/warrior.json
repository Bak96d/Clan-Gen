    "I see you're up early... Keen to get a start on the day, are we? Or perhaps something's troubling you?", 
    "Our lives as warriors aren't without their thorns, are they? But remember, even the sharpest thorn is less threatening when you face it with your Clanmates at your side.", 
    "Oh, and about last Gathering... Yes, I noticed the tension too. ThornClan seems restless. We must be ready for anything.",
    "But let's not allow the possibility of trouble to overshadow this beautiful day, alright? We are warriors, but we also appreciate the peace when it's granted to us.",    
    "So come on, let's face the day, paw step by paw step, side by side. May StarClan light our path."]
